# Analog Film Lab – Operations & Website Notes

This file is **for you only** (internal notes).  
Add it to the root of your GitHub repository so you always have a clear reference for:

- How you want to handle **negatives, samples and damaged film**
- What your **website should include**
- How you want to **position your lab** and use Instagram

Netlify will ignore this file for the live site – it is just documentation.

---

## 1. Handling negatives, samples & damaged film

These are suggested policies and texts you can adjust to your own preferences.

### 1.1. When a customer sends film

Ask customers to include in the package (or in the order notes):

- Full name
- Email address
- Order reference (if you use one)
- Film type(s) and number of rolls
- Whether the film is:
  - **Normal, unexposed rolls**
  - **Test / sample negatives**
  - **Already-developed negatives for scanning only**
  - **Damaged, expired or “mystery” rolls**

You can add a short line in your order popup description for them to clarify this:

> *“If you are sending already-developed negatives, test strips or damaged film, please mention it in the description box.”*

### 1.2. Policy for damaged / risky film

You can use wording like this on your website or FAQ:

> **Damaged, expired or risky film**  
> I will always treat your negatives with care, but heavily damaged, badly stored or very old film is more likely to have issues (strong grain, colour shifts, fog, scratches, missing frames).  
>  
> I will do my best to recover as much as possible, but I cannot guarantee results and I am not responsible for pre-existing damage.

Optionally, you can decide on a simple rule for payment:

- Either **full price** regardless of outcome, or  
- **Reduced price** / “no charge if totally blank”

Write down what you want here:

- My decision: `______________________________________________`

### 1.3. Handling negative samples

If someone asks for **test scans** or sends a **sample strip**:

> **Sample or test scans**  
> If you are unsure about my style or about the condition of your negatives, you can send a small strip or one test roll first. I will scan it and send you samples before we process the rest.

You can:

- Offer **a lower sample price**  
- Or include sample scans as part of a first order

Write your policy here:

- Sample price / rule: `_________________________________________`

### 1.4. Returning negatives

Decide if you will:

- Always return negatives
- Return only on request
- Charge extra for return shipping

Example text for the site:

> **Do I get my negatives back?**  
> Yes, I can return your negatives on request. Return shipping has an extra cost depending on your location. Please mention in your order if you want your negatives back.

Write your rule:

- Return policy: `_____________________________________________`

## 2. Website structure – what your site should include

You already have a very good start with your current single-page site.  
These notes summarize what should be present as you evolve it.

### 🌐 2.1. Homepage (landing section)

Make sure the homepage clearly answers:

- **Who you are**  
  > Independent analog film lab run by [your name].
- **What you offer**  
  > Film development and scanning for 35mm and 120 – colour and black & white.
- **What makes you special**  
  - Quality hand-edited scans
  - Consistent aesthetic
  - Friendly communication
  - Fast turnaround thanks to quick shipping & workflow

You already have this in your hero section – you can refine the text over time.

---

### 2.2. “How it works” – step-by-step

This is **very important**. Keep it simple and clear:

1. **Order online**  
   Customer fills the form on your website and chooses:
   - Colour or black & white
   - Development only / scan only / both
   - Number of rolls

2. **Ship or drop off film**  
   Customer:
   - Packs the rolls in a small padded envelope
   - Adds their name & email inside
   - Ships to your address (or drops off locally if you allow it)

3. **Development & scanning**  
   You:
   - Develop the film (C-41 or B&W)
   - Scan at your standard resolution
   - Apply your usual colour/contrast look

4. **Delivery**  
   Customer:
   - Receives a **download link** to their scans via email (WeTransfer, Drive, Dropbox, etc.)
   - Optionally gets their negatives back if requested

You can add a line about **turnaround time**:

> Typical turnaround: **X–Y days** from the day the film arrives.

Add your own number here for your reference:

- Turnaround time: `___________________________________________`

---

### 2.3. Transparent pricing

Your current prices:

- Scanning only – **€4 per roll**
- Development only – **colour film – €6 per roll**
- Development only – **black and white film – €8 per roll**
- Development + scanning – **colour film – €10 per roll**
- Development + scanning – **black and white film – €12 per roll**

You can expand later with:

- **Return shipping for negatives**
- **High-res scans** or **TIFF scans** at a higher price
- Optional **push/pull** fee per stop

Add ideas here:

- Extra options I may add later:
  - `______________________________________________________`
  - `______________________________________________________`

---

### 2.4. Portfolio section

At some point it is good to add a **small portfolio** to the site:

- 5–10 images that:
  - Show your **colour style**
  - Show your **black & white tonality**
  - Are consistent (similar contrast & vibe)

You can later create a `portfolio` section in your HTML with 2–3 rows of images.

Notes for yourself:

- Best images to include:
  - `______________________________________________________`
  - `______________________________________________________`

---

### 2.5. FAQ – suggested questions

You can add an FAQ section to your site with questions like:

- **How long does it take?**
- **What file format do I get?**
- **Do you offer push/pull development?**
- **Do I get my negatives back?**
- **Do you accept damaged or expired film?**
- **What happens if my film comes out blank?**
- **How do I pay? (PayPal only, for now)**

You can reuse the texts written above in this notes file.

## 3. Instagram as your main channel

Instagram is perfect for analog work.  
Here is how you can align your content with your lab:

### 3.1. What to post

- Before/after scans  
- Full rolls / contact sheets  
- Close-ups of negatives hanging to dry  
- Your scanning setup (even if it’s the university scanner for now)  
- Satisfying short clips of:
  - film in the tank
  - scanning progress
  - you holding developed strips up to the light

---

### 3.2. Style & branding

Try to be **visually consistent**:

- Similar colour grading
- Similar contrast
- Similar crops & borders
- Maybe subtle borders or film edges

This will help people recognize **“your lab look”**.

You can decide on a few style keywords you like:

- My scanning style:
  - `warm / neutral / cool`
  - `soft contrast / punchy contrast`
  - `pastel / cinematic / natural`

Fill in for yourself:

- I want my scans to feel:  
  `________________________________________________________`

---

### 3.3. Hashtags & communication

Useful hashtags for growth:

- `#analogphotography`
- `#filmisnotdead`
- `#shootfilmstaybroke`
- `#35mmfilm`
- `#120film`
- `#filmcommunity`
- `#filmprocessing`
- `#filmphotography`

You can also occasionally tag:

- Film stocks you use
- Camera brands
- Your city (for local clients)

Tone of voice:

- Friendly, a bit nerdy, but clear
- Show that you care about every roll
- Encourage people to DM with questions

---

## 4. You are ready

You now have:

- A **working website** with an order popup and PayPal
- A plan to:
  - handle **negatives, samples and damaged film**
  - explain **how it works**
  - show prices clearly
  - grow via **Instagram**

You can update this notes file anytime as your lab evolves.  
Just keep pushing film through the tank – the rest will grow over time. 🎞️
